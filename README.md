## POETREE: An Animated Tree Poem

Coding by Sebastian Madriz. Poem written by Court Smith.

## Project Overview

This project's origins are based on community. What does community mean to you? That is the question I had to ask myself at the beginning of this project. This project is about exploring through the written word what community means to me. To me, community is about strength and stability. And most importantly, our community is our family. For this project, I have chosen the concrete poem Spotted Owl by Court Smith which I believe had a message that expressed how I felt about community.

## Technical Overview

This project uses a combination of HTML and CSS to create the changes in visuals.
