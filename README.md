## POETREE: An Animated Tree Poem

Coding by Sebastian Madriz. Poem written by Court Smith.

## Project Overview

This project's origins are based on community. What does community mean to you? That is the question I had to ask myself at the beginning of this project. This project is about exploring through the written word what community means to me. To me, community is about strength and stability. And most importantly, our community is our family. For this project, I have chosen the concrete poem Spotted Owl by Court Smith which I believe had a message that expressed how I felt about community. I would demonstrate the feeling this poem gave me by coding an animation of the poem I selected, only allowing myself to change the typography and colors using HTML and CSS.

## Technical Overview

This project uses a combination of HTML and CSS to create the changes in visuals.

The font used was Capitolina. Pulled from Adobe Fonts.

No java or images were used in this project. The only image in the img folder is a visual reference for the shape of the final page.

Using the page is simple. To trigger changes to the text you have to hover your mouse over the lightest text on the page. To get to the next page you have to wait for any animations to finish and then click on the animated line of text to continue onto the next. This page uses a combination of animations and transitions to create different visual effects.
